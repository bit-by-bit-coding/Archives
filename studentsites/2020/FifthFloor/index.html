    <p class="typewriter" id="fred">"You stare at your name tag: it reads Bob. You work as a financial analyist. Last year, your boss gave you a promotion for your excellent work and diligence. Because of that, your office is now located on the fifth floor. You also have an old office on the second floor. You live in an apartment five blocks away from your office. Your real name is Robert, but people like to call you Bob, thus, you decided to change your official name to Bob. Everyone in the building knows Bob. Some know you as the one who loves going to the local bakery next door. Some know you as simply passionate about your job. The current time is August 12, 2020 12:50PM.</p>
