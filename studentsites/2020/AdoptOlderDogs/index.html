 <p><h2> Intro </h2></p>
<p> 
    Hi friends! Today im going to tell you <br>
    why you should consider adopting an older dog instead of <br>
     maybe a puppy or younger dog like you may have been considering. <br>
   In this article there are three reasons <br>
  why you should adopt an older dog. Read on because if you do, <br>
you could end up saving a life.  </p>

<h2> 1- You Will Be Saving an Adorable Dog</h2> <br>
So I'm assuming you are fairly aware of what happens to those <br>
 poor doggos who don't get adopted. In case you don't, <br>
 let me tell you. Sadly the dogs and cats who don't find a home and a loving <br>
 family get euthanized. Euthanizing is when a pet is put to sleep. On <br>
 average, 1.5 MILLION dogs and cats get put to sleep each year. Some reasons <br>
 a dog or cat is put down is because they are sick, old, or aren't getting <br>
 adopted. Now i bet you are wondering "how does this tie indo adopting older dogs?" <br>
 WELL MY FRIEND, the way this ties into older dogs getting adopted is <br>
 that most dogs not getting adopted are OLDER DOGS. One of <br>
 the major things that adults and kids factor into adoption <br>
 is age. Most people want younger dogs when adopting because they are worried <br>
about mortality. But what they don't realize is that this leaves <br>
one more poor doggie that is left to spend the rest <br>
of its life alone in a shelter without a family. And as I explained before, <br>
the dogs that dont get adopted in shelters sometimes get put down because the <br>
people who run the shelter veiw them as a waste of supplies.

<p><h2>2- They are Calmer and Most of the Time are Already Trained</h2></p>
<p>One other reason to adopt an older dog is that they are easier <br>
to handle and overall calmer. Although they still require exercise, <br>
they do not require the same amount as, say, a puppy. That is one caveat to <br>
getting a younger dog: with a puppy it's playtime all the time. <br>
Puppies are pretty reckless and chew on almost anything. Older dogs have already gone through <br>
that stage of their life and are now calmer and less likely to do destructive<br>
things that younger dogs might be more inclined to do. They are also <br>
most of the time already trained so you don't have to take them to a training <br>
center or spend lots of time training them. They overall are less work. </p>

<p><h2>3-They Need Less Vet Visits </h2></p>
Now I know what you are probably thinking: "Dont they need more vet visits?" <br>
The funny thing is that that is actually not the case. Unless you adopt a dog <br>
with special needs or health complications (wich isn't a bad idea <br>
and I would actually advise you to consider that), older dogs actually <br>
much less veterinary visits. They are almost always already spayed or neutered <br>
and have already had all their rounds of vaccinations. They are also much less <br>
susceptible to sickness since their immune system is already built up <br>

<p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p>
<p>So in this article, you have heard my reasons on why you should <br>
adopt an older dog. Older dogs are esier to handle, need fewer vet visits,<br>
and you will end up possibly saving a life! So be a good human <br>
          <br><h1>And go adopt an older dog :)</h1></p>
