<h4>Wow! These pancakes were the best I've EVER HAD.</h4>
<p>No one in my family thought they were vegan, and if I hadn't made them, I probably would have thought that too!</p>
<p>They have a real diner feel to them, but no buttermilk needed! They're also very filling, I was full on my second one! I guarantee that these pancakes will sadisfy everyone, vegan or not!</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons organic sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup non-dairy milk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>Maple syrup, to serve</li>
</ul>

<h3>Let's Cook!</h3>
<p>In a medium bowl, add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt, and stir to combine.
    In a medium bowl or liquid measuring cup, add almond milk, apple cider vinegar, and vanilla, and stir to combine
    Pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture and whisk until smooth.
    Let batter rest for 5 minutes.
    Pour about ½ cup (65 grams) of batter onto a nonstick pan or griddle over medium heat.
    When the top begins to bubble, flip the pancake and cook until golden.
    Serve warm with maple syrup.
